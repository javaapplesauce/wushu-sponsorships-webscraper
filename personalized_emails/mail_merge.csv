Dear The Whale Tea General Inquiries Team,

I’m Richard Li, Vice President of Columbia University Wushu, New York City’s largest collegiate martial arts club. We host public practices, organize performances, and attend both regional and national Wushu competitions. Our work is shown on our website, columbiawushu.org, and our instagram page, @columbiawushu. The events our club hosts are organized by undergraduate students alone; students seeking to empower our university’s community, and enable the student body to engage with Asian culture. 

Last year, Columbia Wushu hosted our first annual showcase, which hosted 5+ other performing-arts clubs, boasted a Red Bull sponsorship, and garnered over 200+ student body attendees. This year, Columbia Wushu, along with Columbia Lion Dance, are starting the year off strong by organizing a workshop on 10/25 at 3:00 PM in Columbia Sundial meant to teach new and interested individuals the fundamentals of Wushu and Lion Dancing. In order to expand and incentivize engagement with the student body, we are kindly asking for your support in the form of <dynamic>our delicious bubble teas and refreshing drinks, or perhaps some branded merchandise such as stickers or pins.</dynamic>

<dynamic>We felt compelled to reach out to The Whale Tea not only because our members enjoy your refreshing tea and boba drinks, but also because we believe your commitment to quality and customer experience aligns well with our club’s ethos.</dynamic> If this event aligns with The Whale Tea’s mission, then it’s an amazing opportunity to connect with a strong undergraduate community in New York. Any level of help would meaningfully expand outreach to Asian culture on our campus. 

In return, we’ll deliver clear impact and visibility:

Recognition: Acknowledgment of your brand on event banners (within reserved venues), following Columbia branding policies.

Touchpoint: Direct communication with Columbia University’s largest martial arts club.

Shoutouts: Mentions across our social media and newsletters.

Special Opportunities: Invitations to attend our performances as guests of honor.

Any other mutually agreed promotional synergy.

If this aligns with The Whale Tea's mission, I’d love to schedule a brief call. Thank you for considering a partnership that would directly reduce barriers and increase outreach. We believe this collaboration could deliver a meaningful impact, for both your organization and our student community.

Warm regards,
Richard Li

We host public practices, organize performances, and attend both regional and national Wushu competitions. Our work is shown on our website, columbiawushu.org, and our instagram page, @columbiawushu. The events our club hosts are organized by undergraduate students alone; students seeking to empower our university’s community, and enable the student body to engage with Asian culture. 

Last year, Columbia Wushu hosted our first annual showcase, which hosted 5+ other performing-arts clubs, boasted a Red Bull sponsorship, and garnered over 200+ student body attendees. This year, Columbia Wushu, along with Columbia Lion Dance, are starting the year off strong by organizing a workshop on 10/25 at 3:00 PM in Columbia Sundial meant to teach new and interested individuals the fundamentals of Wushu and Lion Dancing. In order to expand and incentivize engagement with the student body, we are kindly asking for your support in the form of <dynamic>refreshments, or perhaps some delightful items and special offers from Isle of Us.</dynamic>

<dynamic>We felt compelled to reach out to you not only because our members enjoy your products, but also because we believe your business’s values closely align with our club’s.</dynamic> If this event aligns with Isle of Us’s mission, then it’s an amazing opportunity to connect with a strong undergraduate community in New York. Any level of help would meaningfully expand outreach to Asian culture on our campus. 

In return, we’ll deliver clear impact and visibility:

Recognition: Acknowledgment of your brand on event banners (within reserved venues), following Columbia branding policies.

Touchpoint: Direct communication with Columbia University’s largest martial arts club.

Shoutouts: Mentions across our social media and newsletters.

Special Opportunities: Invitations to attend our performances as guests of honor.

Any other mutually agreed promotional synergy.

If this aligns with Isle of Us's mission, I’d love to schedule a brief call. Thank you for considering a partnership that would directly reduce barriers and increase outreach. We believe this collaboration could deliver a meaningful impact, for both your organization and our student community.

Warm regards,
Richard Li

I’m Richard Li, Vice President of Columbia University Wushu, New York City’s largest collegiate martial arts club. We host public practices, organize performances, and attend both regional and national Wushu competitions. Our work is shown on our website, columbiawushu.org, and our instagram page, @columbiawushu. The events our club hosts are organized by undergraduate students alone; students seeking to empower our university’s community, and enable the student body to engage with Asian culture. 

Last year, Columbia Wushu hosted our first annual showcase, which hosted 5+ other performing-arts clubs, boasted a Red Bull sponsorship, and garnered over 200+ student body attendees. This year, Columbia Wushu, along with Columbia Lion Dance, are starting the year off strong by organizing a workshop on 10/25 at 3:00 PM in Columbia Sundial meant to teach new and interested individuals the fundamentals of Wushu and Lion Dancing. In order to expand and incentivize engagement with the student body, we are kindly asking for your support in the form of <dynamic>refreshments from our menu, or promotional items like branded merchandise.</dynamic>

<dynamic>We felt compelled to reach out to you not only because our members enjoy the vibrant atmosphere and offerings at Printers Alley, but also because we believe your establishment’s values closely align with our club’s.</dynamic> If this event aligns with Printers Alley’s mission, then it’s an amazing opportunity to connect with a strong undergraduate community in New York. Any level of help would meaningfully expand outreach to Asian culture on our campus. 

In return, we’ll deliver clear impact and visibility:

Recognition: Acknowledgment of your brand on event banners (within reserved venues), following Columbia branding policies.

Touchpoint: Direct communication with Columbia University’s largest martial arts club.

Shoutouts: Mentions across our social media and newsletters.

Special Opportunities: Invitations to attend our performances as guests of honor.

Any other mutually agreed promotional synergy.

If this aligns with Printers Alley's mission, I’d love to schedule a brief call. Thank you for considering a partnership that would directly reduce barriers and increase outreach. We believe this collaboration could deliver a meaningful impact, for both your organization and our student community.

Warm regards,
Richard Li

Dear FIFTYLAN KOREATOWN General Inquiries,

I’m Richard Li, Vice President of Columbia University Wushu, New York City’s largest collegiate martial arts club. We host public practices, organize performances, and attend both regional and national Wushu competitions. Our work is shown on our website, columbiawushu.org, and our instagram page, @columbiawushu. The events our club hosts are organized by undergraduate students alone; students seeking to empower our university’s community, and enable the student body to engage with Asian culture. 

Last year, Columbia Wushu hosted our first annual showcase, which hosted 5+ other performing-arts clubs, boasted a Red Bull sponsorship, and garnered over 200+ student body attendees. This year, Columbia Wushu, along with Columbia Lion Dance, are starting the year off strong by organizing a workshop on 10/25 at 3:00 PM in Columbia Sundial meant to teach new and interested individuals the fundamentals of Wushu and Lion Dancing. In order to expand and incentivize engagement with the student body, we are kindly asking for your support in the form of <dynamic>refreshments, such as our delicious drinks, or promotional materials like stickers, pins, and branded apparel.</dynamic>

<dynamic>We were compelled to reach out because our members consistently enjoy the offerings from FIFTYLAN KOREATOWN, and we also believe your franchise’s values resonate strongly with our club’s.</dynamic> If this event aligns with FIFTYLAN KOREATOWN’s mission, then it’s an amazing opportunity to connect with a strong undergraduate community in New York. Any level of help would meaningfully expand outreach to Asian culture on our campus. 

In return, we’ll deliver clear impact and visibility:

Recognition: Acknowledgment of your brand on event banners (within reserved venues), following Columbia branding policies.

Touchpoint: Direct communication with Columbia University’s largest martial arts club.

Shoutouts: Mentions across our social media and newsletters.

Special Opportunities: Invitations to attend our performances as guests of honor.

Any other mutually agreed promotional synergy.

If this aligns with FIFTYLAN KOREATOWN's mission, I’d love to schedule a brief call. Thank you for considering a partnership that would directly reduce barriers and increase outreach. We believe this collaboration could deliver a meaningful impact, for both your organization and our student community.

Warm regards,

Dear Tiger Mart Management,

I’m Richard Li, Vice President of Columbia University Wushu, New York City’s largest collegiate martial arts club. We host public practices, organize performances, and attend both regional and national Wushu competitions. Our work is shown on our website, columbiawushu.org, and our instagram page, @columbiawushu.

Last year, Columbia Wushu hosted our first annual showcase, which hosted 5+ other performing-arts clubs, boasted a Red Bull sponsorship, and garnered over 200+ student body attendees. This year, Columbia Wushu, along with Columbia Lion Dance, are starting the year off strong by organizing a workshop on 10/25 at 3:00 PM in Columbia Sundial meant to teach new and interested individuals the fundamentals of Wushu and Lion Dancing. In order to expand and incentivize engagement with the student body, we are kindly asking for your support in the form of <dynamic>refreshments, or promotional items such as drinks, stickers, pins, apparel, and more.</dynamic>

<dynamic>We felt compelled to reach out not only because our members enjoy Tiger Mart's offerings, but also because we believe your mission to provide 'Energy to take you further' closely aligns with our club’s values.</dynamic> If this event aligns with Tiger Mart’s mission, then it’s an amazing opportunity to connect with a strong undergraduate community in New York. Any level of help would meaningfully expand outreach to Asian culture on our campus. 

In return, we’ll deliver clear impact and visibility:

Recognition: Acknowledgment of your brand on event banners (within reserved venues), following Columbia branding policies.

Touchpoint: Direct communication with Columbia University’s largest martial arts club.

Shoutouts: Mentions across our social media and newsletters.

Special Opportunities: Invitations to attend our performances as guests of honor.

Any other mutually agreed promotional synergy.

If this aligns with Tiger Mart's mission, I’d love to schedule a brief call. Thank you for considering a partnership that would directly reduce barriers and increase outreach. We believe this collaboration could deliver a meaningful impact, for both your organization and our student community.

Warm regards,
Richard Li

I’m Richard Li, Vice President of Columbia University Wushu, New York City’s largest collegiate martial arts club. We host public practices, organize performances, and attend both regional and national Wushu competitions. Our work is shown on our website, columbiawushu.org, and our instagram page, @columbiawushu. The events our club hosts are organized by undergraduate students alone; students seeking to empower our university’s community, and enable the student body to engage with Asian culture. 

Last year, Columbia Wushu hosted our first annual showcase, which hosted 5+ other performing-arts clubs, boasted a Red Bull sponsorship, and garnered over 200+ student body attendees. This year, Columbia Wushu, along with Columbia Lion Dance, are starting the year off strong by organizing a workshop on 10/25 at 3:00 PM in Columbia Sundial meant to teach new and interested individuals the fundamentals of Wushu and Lion Dancing. In order to expand and incentivize engagement with the student body, we are kindly asking for your support in the form of <dynamic>refreshments, or unique items such as their carefully selected Chinese teas, tea ware, and general goods.</dynamic>

<dynamic>We felt compelled to reach out to you not only because our members enjoy your carefully selected Chinese teas and unique tea ware, but also because we believe the dedication and cultural appreciation of 梅舎茶館 align closely with our club’s values.</dynamic> If this event aligns with 梅舎茶館(メイシャチャカン)’s mission, then it’s an amazing opportunity to connect with a strong undergraduate community in New York. Any level of help would meaningfully expand outreach to Asian culture on our campus. 

In return, we’ll deliver clear impact and visibility:

Recognition: Acknowledgment of your brand on event banners (within reserved venues), following Columbia branding policies.

Touchpoint: Direct communication with Columbia University’s largest martial arts club.

Shoutouts: Mentions across our social media and newsletters.

Special Opportunities: Invitations to attend our performances as guests of honor.

Any other mutually agreed promotional synergy.

If this aligns with 梅舎茶館(メイシャチャカン)'s mission, I’d love to schedule a brief call. Thank you for considering a partnership that would directly reduce barriers and increase outreach. We believe this collaboration could deliver a meaningful impact, for both your organization and our student community.

Warm regards,
Richard Li
