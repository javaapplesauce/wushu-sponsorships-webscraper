This year, Columbia Wushu, along with Columbia Lion Dance, are starting the year off strong by organizing a workshop on 10/25 at 3:00 PM in Columbia Sundial meant to teach new and interested individuals the fundamentals of Wushu and Lion Dancing.

We host public practices, organize performances, and attend both regional and national Wushu competitions. Our work is shown on our website, columbiawushu.org, and our instagram page, @columbiawushu. The events our club hosts are organized by undergraduate students alone; students seeking to empower our university’s community, and enable the student body to engage with Asian culture. \n\nLast year, Columbia Wushu hosted our first annual showcase, which hosted 5+ other performing-arts clubs, boasted a Red Bull sponsorship, and garnered over 200+ student body attendees. This year, Columbia Wushu, along with Columbia Lion Dance, are starting the year off strong by organizing a workshop on 10/25 at 3:00 PM in Columbia Sundial meant to teach new and interested individuals the fundamentals of Wushu and Lion Dancing. In order to expand and incentivize engagement with the student body, we are kindly asking for your support in the form of refreshments, or promotional materials; drinks, stickers, pins, clothes, etc.\n\nWe felt compelled to reach out to you not only because our members enjoy your products, but also because we believe your franchise’s values closely align with our club’s. If this event aligns with Lucky Strike Times Square’s mission, then it’s an amazing opportunity to connect with a strong undergraduate community in New York.
